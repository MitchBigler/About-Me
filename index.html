--REFLECTION--
This assignment was a good way for me to learn how to better use the
HTML tags that I learned through the course this week. It gave me a
good variety of attributes to recall and implement.
I was able to refer to my notes for most of the basic elements, but for
all of the extra items I had to look them up and read documentation or
other examples. I took a web design class years ago in high school and
used my very basic knowledge of CSS to link the stylesheet and get it
done.
