--REFLECTION--
This assignment taught me a lot about CSS. I now know that I still have a lot
to learn about positioning. I never expected it to be so difficult. I enjoyed learning
how to make a fixed header and attempting to create a repeating pattern- even though
it ended up looking like a pattern for a pillowcase :/ My next attempt will be better.
